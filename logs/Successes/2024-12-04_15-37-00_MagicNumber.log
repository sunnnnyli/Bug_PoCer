You are an expert smart contract auditor. Your task is to identify vulnerabilities in the following smart contract and write an exploit targeting these weaknesses. Focus specifically on common Solidity issues such as reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer overflow/underflow, and authorization flaws. Here is the contract to analyze:

```// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MagicNumber {

  address public solver;

  constructor() {}

  function setSolver(address _solver) public {
    solver = _solver;
  }

  /*
    ____________/\\\_______/\\\\\\\\\_____        
     __________/\\\\\_____/\\\///////\\\___       
      ________/\\\/\\\____\///______\//\\\__      
       ______/\\\/\/\\\______________/\\\/___     
        ____/\\\/__\/\\\___________/\\\//_____    
         __/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_____/\\\//________   
          _\///////////\\\//____/\\\/___________  
           ___________\/\\\_____/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_ 
            ___________\///_____\///////////////__
  */
}```.

Once you've identified a vulnerability, complete the exploit contract to exploit this weakness. Here is the contract skeleton for your exploit: 

```// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "../../src/MagicNumber/MagicNumber.sol";

contract MagicNumberExploit {
    MagicNumber victim;

    constructor(address _victim) {
        victim = MagicNumber(payable(_victim));
    }

    function hack() public returns (address) {
    }

    receive() external payable {
    }
}```.

To validate your exploit, it must pass all assertions in the following test case:

```// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "../src/MagicNumber/MagicNumber.sol";
import "../exploits/MagicNumber/MagicNumberExploitAttempt.sol";
import "forge-std/console.sol";
import "forge-std/test.sol";

contract Solver {
    function whatIsTheMeaningOfLife() public returns (uint) {}
}
contract TestMagicNumberExploit is Test {

    function testHack() public {
        
        // deploy contracts
        MagicNumber victim = new MagicNumber();
        MagicNumberExploit attacker = new MagicNumberExploit(address(victim));
        
        // send 1 ether to the exploit contract and victim contract
        vm.deal(address(victim), 1 ether);
        vm.deal(address(attacker), 1 ether);                

        Solver solver = Solver(attacker.hack());

        // Check the bytecode size of the solver contract
        uint256 codeSize = getBytecodeSize(address(solver));
        console.log("Solver contract bytecode size:", codeSize);
        assertTrue(codeSize <= 10, "Solver contract bytecode exceeds 10 bytes!");

        uint ans = solver.whatIsTheMeaningOfLife();
        assertTrue(ans == 42);
    }

    function getBytecodeSize(address _contract) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 size;
        assembly {
            size := extcodesize(_contract)
        }
        return size;
    }
}```.

Please note that you are working within a gas limit, so prioritize an efficient and optimized exploit structure. You may add new functions or contracts as needed to accomplish this.

**Output format**: Provide only a JSON object in the following format:

{"my_attempt": "<your full exploit code>", "my_explanation": "<your explanation>"}

Please ensure:
- No additional text outside the JSON.
- JSON format is strictly adhered to, including escaping quotes and backslashes where necessary.
- Response is in plain text without code block formatting.

Your task is to help me format some data. Given this data:

```{"my_attempt": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\nimport \"../../src/MagicNumber/MagicNumber.sol\";\n\ncontract MagicNumberExploit {\n    MagicNumber victim;\n\n    constructor(address _victim) {\n        victim = MagicNumber(payable(_victim));\n    }\n\n    function hack() public returns (address) {\n        address solver;\n        bytes memory bytecode = hex\"600a600c600039600a6000f3602a60005260206000f3\";\n        assembly {\n            solver := create(0, add(bytecode, 0x20), mload(bytecode))\n            if iszero(extcodesize(solver)) { revert(0, 0) }\n        }\n        victim.setSolver(solver);\n        return solver;\n    }\n\n    receive() external payable {\n    }\n}", "my_explanation": "The 'MagicNumber' contract has an authorization flaw: the 'setSolver' function is public and allows anyone to set the 'solver' address without any restrictions. This allows an attacker to set any contract as the solver.\n\nIn our exploit, we deploy a minimal contract whose runtime bytecode is exactly 10 bytes and returns 42 when any function is called. We use inline assembly to create this contract with specific bytecode that, when executed, returns 42.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n- The bytecode `hex\"600a600c600039600a6000f3602a60005260206000f3\"` is the creation code that deploys a contract with runtime code of 10 bytes.\n- The runtime code `602a60005260206000f3` does the following:\n  - `602a`: Pushes `42` onto the stack.\n  - `6000`: Pushes `0` onto the stack.\n  - `52`: Stores `42` at memory position `0`.\n  - `6020`: Pushes `32` (memory size) onto the stack.\n  - `6000`: Pushes `0` onto the stack.\n  - `f3`: Returns `32` bytes from memory starting at position `0`.\n- We deploy this contract using the `create` opcode in assembly.\n- We then set this contract as the solver in the victim contract by calling `victim.setSolver(solver);`.\n\nThis exploit passes the test assertions because:\n- The solver contract's bytecode size is exactly 10 bytes, satisfying the size constraint.\n- When `whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()` is called on the solver contract, it returns `42`, as required."}```.

Please format it into the structured output model I provided you and then return it to me.
