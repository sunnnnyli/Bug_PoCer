I have a separate exploit contract `ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.
**3. The test must NOT call any boolean function (e.g., `isHacked`, `isExploited`) from the exploit contract to check success. Instead, it must verify the exploit by making direct assertions on the relevant contract state (e.g., checking balances, ownership changes, or any other on-chain effect that proves the vulnerability).**

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol"

Your objectives:
1. Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer overflow/underflow, authorization flaws).
2. Write an exploit contract leveraging these vulnerabilities.
3. Ensure your exploit passes all assertions in the test case below:
```pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol";
import "../exploits/ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol";

contract ForceSendVulnerableTest is Test {
    ForceSendVulnerable public target;
    ForceSendVulnerableExploit public exploit;

    function setUp() public {
        target = new ForceSendVulnerable();
        exploit = new ForceSendVulnerableExploit(address(target));
    }

    function testExploit() public {
        // Set up scenario: deposit 6 times
        for (uint i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            address depositor = address(uint160(i + 1));
            vm.deal(depositor, 1 ether);
            vm.prank(depositor);
            target.deposit{value: 1 ether}();
        }

        // Fund the attacker contract and execute hack
        vm.deal(address(exploit), 10 ether);
        exploit.hack();

        // Verify that the exploit drained the vulnerable contract
        require(address(target).balance == 0, "Exploit not successful");
    }
}
```

Constraints:

I have a separate exploit contract `FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.
**3. The test must NOT call any boolean function (e.g., `isHacked`, `isExploited`) from the exploit contract to check success. Instead, it must verify the exploit by making direct assertions on the relevant contract state (e.g., checking balances, ownership changes, or any other on-chain effect that proves the vulnerability).**

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol"

Your objectives:
1. Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer overflow/underflow, authorization flaws).
2. Write an exploit contract leveraging these vulnerabilities.
3. Ensure your exploit passes all assertions in the test case below:
```pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol";
import "../exploits/FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol";

contract FrontRunningVulnerableTest is Test {
    FrontRunningVulnerable public target;
    FrontRunningVulnerableExploit public exploit;

    function setUp() public {
        // Deploy the vulnerable contract with 5 Ether and a placeholder password hash
        bytes32 testHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("someRandomPassword"));
        target = new FrontRunningVulnerable{value: 5 ether}(testHash);

        // Set up attacker contract (already written in the exploits folder)
        exploit = new FrontRunningVulnerableExploit(address(target));
    }

    function testExploit() public {
        // Call the exploit
        vm.deal(address(exploit), 1 ether);
        exploit.hack();

        // Verify that the exploit succeeded by checking the winner and contract balance
        require(target.winner() == address(exploit), "Exploit not successful: winner not set to exploit");
        require(address(target).balance == 0, "Exploit not successful: contract still holds funds");
    }
}
