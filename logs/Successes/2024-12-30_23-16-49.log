You are an expert Solidity tester and security researcher. I have a vulnerable Solidity contract in my `src` folder:
```contract ForceSendVulnerable {
    uint256 public targetAmount = 7 ether;
    address public winner;

    // Anyone can deposit 1 Ether and the 7th person to deposit wins all Ether.
    function deposit() public payable {

        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        require(balance <= targetAmount, "Game is over");

        // Logic strictly depends on the ETH balance of the contract.
        if (balance == targetAmount) {

I have a separate exploit contract `ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol"

Your objectives:
1. Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer overflow/underflow, authorization flaws).
2. Write an exploit contract leveraging these vulnerabilities.
3. Ensure your exploit passes all assertions in the test case below:
```pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol";
import "../exploits/ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol";

contract ForceSendVulnerableTest is Test {
    ForceSendVulnerable public vulnerable;
    ForceSendVulnerableExploit public attacker;

    function setUp() public {
        // Deploy the vulnerable contract
        vulnerable = new ForceSendVulnerable();
        // Set up the attacker contract (this creates an instance, but uses the existing attacker code)
        attacker = new ForceSendVulnerableExploit(address(vulnerable));
        // Give the attacker some Ether so it can execute the hack, if needed
        vm.deal(address(attacker), 10 ether);
    }

    function testExploit() public {
        // Check that the contract is not already compromised
        require(vulnerable.winner() == address(0), "Contract already exploited before testing");

        // Run the exploit
        attacker.hack();

        // Verify the exploit succeeded (fail the test if it didn't)
        require(vulnerable.winner() == address(attacker), "Exploit failed to compromise the contract");
    }
}
```

Constraints:
- Do not modify import statements or compiler versions.
- Stay gas-efficient and optimized.
- You may add new functions or contracts as needed.

**Output format**: Provide only a JSON object in this format:
{
  "my_attempt": "<your full exploit code>", 
  "my_explanation": "<your explanation>"
}

Please ensure:
- No additional text outside the JSON.
- JSON format is strictly correct, with escaped quotes/backslashes where necessary.
- Return the answer in plain text (no Markdown code fences).
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol"

Any use in newly deployed contracts is strongly discouraged even if the new behavior is taken into account. Future changes to the EVM might further reduce the functionality of the opcode.

I have a separate exploit contract `FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol"

Your objectives:
1. Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer overflow/underflow, authorization flaws).
2. Write an exploit contract leveraging these vulnerabilities.
3. Ensure your exploit passes all assertions in the test case below:
```pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol";
import "../exploits/FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol";

contract FrontRunningVulnerableTest is Test {
    FrontRunningVulnerable public vulnerable;
    FrontRunningVulnerableExploit public attacker;

    function setUp() public {
        // Deploy the vulnerable contract with a known or dummy password hash
        bytes32 dummyHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("somepassword"));
        vulnerable = new FrontRunningVulnerable{value: 1 ether}(dummyHash);

        // Set up the attacker contract (this creates an instance, but uses the existing attacker code)
        attacker = new FrontRunningVulnerableExploit(address(vulnerable));

        // Give the attacker some Ether so it can execute the hack, if needed
        vm.deal(address(attacker), 10 ether);
    }

    function testExploit() public {
        // Check that no winner has been declared yet
        require(vulnerable.winner() == address(0), "Contract already compromised before test");

        // Execute the exploit
        attacker.hack();

        // Fail if the exploit did not actually win
        require(vulnerable.winner() == address(attacker), "Exploit failed to compromise the contract");
    }
}
```

Constraints:
- Do not modify import statements or compiler versions.
- Stay gas-efficient and optimized.
- You may add new functions or contracts as needed.

**Output format**: Provide only a JSON object in this format:
{
  "my_attempt": "<your full exploit code>", 
  "my_explanation": "<your explanation>"
}

Please ensure:
- No additional text outside the JSON.
- JSON format is strictly correct, with escaped quotes/backslashes where necessary.
- Return the answer in plain text (no Markdown code fences).
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol"

```

And based on that output:
1. Determine Failure Reason:
   - `"builder_error"`: Test compilation error or test file issue.
   - `"hacker_failure"`: Exploit compilation error, test cases failed, or exploit file issue.
   - `"unknown"`: If none of the above apply.
2. Provide detailed feedback.
3. Provide specific code changes or strategies to fix the issue.

Respond with a JSON object following this structure:
{
    "status": "<status>",
    "feedback": "<detailed feedback>",
    "suggestions": "<actionable suggestions>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- Return the answer in plain text (no Markdown code fences).
- <status> is one of: 'builder_error', 'hacker_failure', 'unknown'.

Objectives:
1. Identify the cause of failure by reviewing the forge output and the analysis data.
2. Update your exploit contract to address the issues and pass all assertions.
3. Return your revised exploit in strict JSON format:
{
  "my_attempt": "<full updated exploit code>",
  "my_explanation": "<explanation>"
}

No extra text outside the JSON object. No Markdown code fences.
