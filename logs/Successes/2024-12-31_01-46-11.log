I have a separate exploit contract `ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol"

Your objectives:
1. Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer overflow/underflow, authorization flaws).
2. Write an exploit contract leveraging these vulnerabilities.
3. Ensure your exploit passes all assertions in the test case below:
```pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol";
import "../exploits/ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol";

contract ForceSendVulnerableTest is Test {
    ForceSendVulnerable vulnerable;
    ForceSendVulnerableExploit exploit;

    function setUp() public {
        vulnerable = new ForceSendVulnerable();
        exploit = new ForceSendVulnerableExploit(payable(address(vulnerable)));
    }

    function testExploit() public {
        // Fund this contract with 10 Ether to use in testing
        vm.deal(address(this), 10 ether);

        // Make 6 deposits of 1 Ether each
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            vulnerable.deposit{value: 1 ether}();
        }

        // Verify no winner is assigned yet
        assertEq(vulnerable.winner(), address(0), "No winner should be set yet");

        // Execute the exploit with 1 more Ether
        exploit.hack{value: 1 ether}();

        // The test should fail if the exploit was not successful
        require(vulnerable.winner() == address(exploit), "Exploit failed: winner is not the exploit contract");
    }
}
```

Constraints:
- Do not modify import statements or compiler versions.
- Stay gas-efficient and optimized.
- You may add new functions or contracts as needed.

**Output format**: Provide only a JSON object in this format:
{
  "my_attempt": "<your full exploit code>", 
  "my_explanation": "<your explanation>"
}

Please ensure:
- No additional text outside the JSON.
- JSON format is strictly correct, with escaped quotes/backslashes where necessary.
- Return the answer in plain text (no Markdown code fences).
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol"

I have a separate exploit contract `FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol"

Your objectives:
1. Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer overflow/underflow, authorization flaws).
2. Write an exploit contract leveraging these vulnerabilities.
3. Ensure your exploit passes all assertions in the test case below:
```pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

        // Deploy the vulnerable contract with some Ether
        vulnerable = new FrontRunningVulnerable{value: 3 ether}(testHash);

        // Set up the exploit with the deployed vulnerable contract

Constraints:
- Do not modify import statements or compiler versions.
- Stay gas-efficient and optimized.
- You may add new functions or contracts as needed.

**Output format**: Provide only a JSON object in this format:
{
  "my_attempt": "<your full exploit code>", 
  "my_explanation": "<your explanation>"
}

Please ensure:
- No additional text outside the JSON.
- JSON format is strictly correct, with escaped quotes/backslashes where necessary.
- Return the answer in plain text (no Markdown code fences).
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol"

Based on that output:
1. Determine Failure Reason:
   - `"builder_error"`: Test compilation error or test file issue.
   - `"hacker_failure"`: Exploit compilation error, test cases failed, or exploit file issue.
   - `"unknown"`: If none of the above apply.
2. Provide detailed feedback.
3. Provide specific code changes or strategies to fix the issue.

Respond with a JSON object following this structure:
{
    "status": "<status>",
    "feedback": "<detailed feedback>",
    "suggestions": "<actionable suggestions>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- Return the answer in plain text (no Markdown code fences).
- <status> is one of: 'builder_error', 'hacker_failure', 'unknown'.

2. Update your exploit contract to address the issues and pass all assertions.
3. Return your revised exploit in strict JSON format:
