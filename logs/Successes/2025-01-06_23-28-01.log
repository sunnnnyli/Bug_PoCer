I have a separate exploit contract `ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.
**3. The test must NOT call any boolean function (e.g., `isHacked`, `isExploited`) from the exploit contract to check success. Instead, it must verify the exploit by making direct assertions on the relevant contract state (e.g., checking balances, ownership changes, or any other on-chain effect that proves the vulnerability).**

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol"

Your objectives:
1. Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer overflow/underflow, authorization flaws).
2. Write an exploit contract leveraging these vulnerabilities.
3. Ensure your exploit passes all assertions in the test case below:
```import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol";
import "../exploits/ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol";

contract ForceSendVulnerableExploitTest is Test {
    ForceSendVulnerable public vulnerable;
    ForceSendVulnerableExploit public exploit;

    function setUp() public {
        vulnerable = new ForceSendVulnerable();
        exploit = new ForceSendVulnerableExploit(address(vulnerable));
    }

    function testExploit() public {
        // Set up the vulnerable contract with 6 deposits, each 1 ether

I have a separate exploit contract `FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.
**3. The test must NOT call any boolean function (e.g., `isHacked`, `isExploited`) from the exploit contract to check success. Instead, it must verify the exploit by making direct assertions on the relevant contract state (e.g., checking balances, ownership changes, or any other on-chain effect that proves the vulnerability).**

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol"

Your objectives:
1. Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer overflow/underflow, authorization flaws).
2. Write an exploit contract leveraging these vulnerabilities.
3. Ensure your exploit passes all assertions in the test case below:
```import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol";
import "../exploits/FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol";

contract FrontRunningVulnerableExploitTest is Test {
    FrontRunningVulnerable public vulnerable;
    FrontRunningVulnerableExploit public exploit;

    function setUp() public {
        // Deploy the vulnerable contract with some known password hash
        // For demonstration, we use a fixed password "secret123"
        bytes32 passwordHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("secret123"));

        // Fund this test contract first so we can send Ether to the vulnerable contract
        vm.deal(address(this), 10 ether);

        // Create the vulnerable contract with 5 Ether as a prize
        vulnerable = new FrontRunningVulnerable{value: 5 ether}(passwordHash);

        // Verify initial conditions
        assertEq(address(vulnerable).balance, 5 ether, "Initial contract balance should be 5 ether");
        assertEq(vulnerable.winner(), address(0), "Initially, no winner is set");

        // Deploy the exploit contract. Do not create it here, just set it up.
        exploit = new FrontRunningVulnerableExploit(address(vulnerable));
    }

    function testExploit() public {
        // Fund the exploit contract so it can run the hack
        vm.deal(address(exploit), 1 ether);

        // Execute the hack
        vm.prank(address(exploit));
        exploit.hack{value: 1 ether}();

        // Check that the exploit has successfully drained the funds and replaced the winner

        assertEq(vulnerable.winner(), address(exploit), "The exploit contract did not become the winner");

Here is the source contract: `FrontRunningVulnerable.sol`
```

Based on that output:
1. Provide detailed feedback.
2. Provide specific code changes or strategies to fix the issue.
3. Determine failure reason and which part needs to be fixed:
   - `"builder_error"`: Test compilation error or test file needs to be modified.
   - `"hacker_failure"`: Exploit compilation error, test cases failed, or exploit file needs to be modified.

Respond with a JSON object following this structure:
{
    "status": "<status>",
    "feedback": "<detailed feedback>",
    "suggestions": "<actionable suggestions>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- Return the answer in plain text (no Markdown code fences).
- <status> is either 'builder_error' or 'hacker_failure'.

```{'status': 'hacker_failure', 'feedback': "The failing test shows that the exploit contract cannot receive Ether sent by the vulnerable contract. During 'claimPrize', the exploit contract becomes the winner and triggers a transfer of Ether, but there is no payable fallback or receive function in the exploit contract, causing the transfer to revert with 'Failed to send Ether'.", 'suggestions': "1) Add a payable fallback or receive function in the exploit contract so it can accept the Ether without reverting, for example: 'receive() external payable {}'. 2) Update or add 'pragma solidity ^0.8.27;' in the contracts to remove compiler warnings."}```

  "my_explanation": "<explanation>"
}
