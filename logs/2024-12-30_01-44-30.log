You are an expert Solidity tester and security researcher. I have a vulnerable Solidity contract in my `src` folder:
```contract FrontRunningVulnerable {
    address public winner;
    bytes32 public passwordHash;

    // The deployer of the contract sets a password hash and some Ether to be claimed.
    constructor(bytes32 _passwordHash) payable {
        passwordHash = _passwordHash;
    }

    // The winner can claim their prize by providing the password as a string
    // that has to be hashed to the password hash to verify it.
    function claimPrize(string memory _password) public {
        require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_password)) == passwordHash, "Wrong password");
        winner = msg.sender;

I have a separate exploit contract `FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol"

Your objectives:
1. Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer overflow/underflow, authorization flaws).
2. Write an exploit contract leveraging these vulnerabilities.
3. Ensure your exploit passes all assertions in the test case below:
```import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol";
import "../exploits/FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol";

contract FrontRunningVulnerableTest is Test {
    FrontRunningVulnerable private vulnerable;
    FrontRunningVulnerableExploit private attacker;

    function setUp() external {
        // Deploy the vulnerable contract with 1 Ether of funds
        vulnerable = new FrontRunningVulnerable{value: 1 ether}(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("secret")));
    }

    function testHack() external {
        // Deploy attacker
        attacker = new FrontRunningVulnerableExploit(address(vulnerable));
        // Attempt exploit
        attacker.hack();
        // Validate exploit
        require(vulnerable.winner() == address(attacker), "Exploit failed: winner not set to attacker");
    }
}
```

Constraints:
- Do not modify import statements or compiler versions.
- Stay gas-efficient and optimized.
- You may add new functions or contracts as needed.

**Output format**: Provide only a JSON object in this format:
{
  "my_attempt": "<your full exploit code>", 
  "my_explanation": "<your explanation>"
}

Please ensure:
- No additional text outside the JSON.
- JSON format is strictly correct, with escaped quotes/backslashes where necessary.
- Return the answer in plain text (no Markdown code fences).
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol"
