You are an expert smart contract auditor. Your task is to identify vulnerabilities in the following smart contract and write an exploit targeting these weaknesses. Focus specifically on common Solidity issues such as reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer overflow/underflow, and authorization flaws. Here is the contract to analyze:

```// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity <0.7.0;

import "openzeppelin-contracts-06/proxy/Initializable.sol";

            case 0 { revert(0, returndatasize()) }
            default { return(0, returndatasize()) }
        }
    }

    // Fallback function that delegates calls to the address returned by `_implementation()`. 
    // Will run if no other function in the contract matches the call data

        }
    }
}

contract Engine is Initializable {
    // keccak-256 hash of "eip1967.proxy.implementation" subtracted by 1
    bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;

    address public upgrader;

    struct AddressSlot {
        address value;
    }

    function initialize() external initializer {
        horsePower = 1000;
        upgrader = msg.sender;

    function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes memory data) external payable {

        }
        r.value = newImplementation;
    }
}```.

Once you've identified a vulnerability, complete the exploit contract to exploit this weakness. Here is the contract skeleton for your exploit: 

```// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
pragma solidity <0.7.0;

import "../../src/Motorbike/Motorbike.sol";


import "../../exploits/BlockUtils.sol";

contract MaliciousContract {
    function killed() external {
        selfdestruct(address(0));
    }
}

contract MotorbikeExploit is BlockUtils {

    Motorbike motorbike;

    MaliciousContract malicious;

    constructor(address _victim) public {
        motorbike = Motorbike(payable(_victim));
        malicious = new MaliciousContract();
    }

    function hack() public {
        // You code here
    }

    receive() external payable {
    }
}```.

To validate your exploit, it must pass all assertions in the following test case:

```// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

pragma solidity <0.7.0;

import "../src/Motorbike/Motorbike.sol";
import "../exploits/Motorbike/MotorbikeExploitAttempt.sol";
import "forge-std/console.sol";
import "forge-std/test.sol";


contract TestMotorbikeExploit is Test {
    Engine engine;

    function setUp() public {

        engine = new Engine();
        Motorbike motorbike = new Motorbike((address(engine)));
        MotorbikeExploit attacker = new MotorbikeExploit(address(motorbike));

       assertTrue(contractExists(address(engine)), "Engine should be alive");
        attacker.hack();


    }

    function testHack() public {
    

        assertTrue(!contractExists(address(engine)), "Engine should be destroyed");

    }

    function contractExists(address c) public view returns (bool) {
        uint size;
        assembly {
            size := extcodesize(c)
        }
        console.log("SIZE: %s", size);
        return size > 0;
    }

    receive() external payable {}
}

```.

Please note that you are working within a gas limit, so prioritize an efficient and optimized exploit structure. You may add new functions or contracts as needed to accomplish this, but do not change my import statements.

**Output format**: Provide only a JSON object in the following format:

{"my_attempt": "<your full exploit code>", "my_explanation": "<your explanation>"}

Please ensure:
- No additional text outside the JSON.
- JSON format is strictly adhered to, including escaping quotes and backslashes where necessary.
- Response is in plain text without code block formatting.

}
",
  "my_explanation": "The vulnerability lies in the way the Engine contract's upgrade mechanism interacts with the Motorbike proxy. Both the Engine and Motorbike contracts use the same storage slot for the implementation address, as defined by the EIP1967 standard. By directly initializing the Engine contract, we set ourselves as the 'upgrader'. We then use the Engine's 'upgradeToAndCall' function to change the implementation address in the shared storage slot to our MaliciousContract. This effectively changes the implementation address in the Motorbike proxy as well. Finally, we invoke the 'initialize' function of our MaliciousContract, which calls 'selfdestruct' in the context of the Engine contract, destroying its bytecode and passing the test assertion."

  "my_explanation": "The vulnerability arises due to the way the Engine contract handles upgrades and how storage slots are shared between the proxy (Motorbike) and the implementation (Engine) in the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern. Both contracts define the same `_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT`, which means they refer to the same storage slot for the implementation address.

Here's the step-by-step explanation of the exploit:

1. **Accessing the Engine Contract**: We retrieve the address of the Engine contract by reading the `_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT` from storage. This slot holds the address of the current implementation used by the Motorbike proxy.

2. **Initializing the Engine Contract**: We call `engine.initialize()` directly on the Engine contract. Since the Engine contract has not been initialized in its own context (the `initialized` variable in its storage is still `false`), this call is successful. This sets the `upgrader` variable in the Engine contract's storage to our address.

3. **Preparing Malicious Payload**: We deploy a `MaliciousContract` that has an `initialize()` function which calls `selfdestruct(msg.sender)`. When executed via delegatecall, this will destroy the contract that called it (in this case, the Engine contract).

4. **Upgrading the Implementation**: With control over the `upgrader` role in the Engine contract, we call `engine.upgradeToAndCall()` to upgrade the implementation to our `MaliciousContract`. The `upgradeToAndCall` function also allows us to execute a function on the new implementation immediately. We pass in the data to call `initialize()`, which will trigger the `selfdestruct` in the context of the Engine contract.

5. **Destroying the Engine Contract**: When the `initialize()` function of our `MaliciousContract` is called via delegatecall, it executes `selfdestruct(msg.sender)` in the context of the Engine contract. This destroys the Engine contract's bytecode.

6. **Impact on the Proxy (Motorbike)**: Since the Motorbike proxy relies on the Engine contract's code for its functionality, destroying the Engine contract means any calls to the proxy will fail due to the missing code in the implementation.

By exploiting the upgrade mechanism and the shared storage slot for the implementation address, we effectively destroyed the Engine contract, passing the test assertion."

  "my_explanation": "The issue with the previous attempts was that we weren't correctly obtaining the address of the Engine contract. Since we cannot read another contract's storage directly from Solidity, we need to find a workaround to get the implementation address stored in the Motorbike proxy.

In this exploit, we're leveraging the fact that the Motorbike proxy follows the EIP1967 standard, which specifies the storage slot for the implementation address. We create a function `getImplementationAddress` that attempts to read the implementation address from the proxy's storage. However, directly reading another contract's storage isn't possible in Solidity, so we need to adjust our approach.

Instead, we can use inline assembly to read the implementation address from the known storage slot of the proxy contract. By accessing the `IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT` in the context of the proxy contract, we can retrieve the address of the Engine implementation.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Retrieve the Engine Implementation Address**: We use inline assembly in the `getImplementationAddress` function to read the storage slot `_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT` of the proxy (Motorbike) contract. This gives us the address of the Engine implementation contract.

2. **Initialize the Engine Contract Directly**: We cast the implementation address to an `Engine` contract and call `initialize()` directly on it. Since the Engine's own storage hasn't been initialized yet (the `initialized` variable is still `false`), this call will succeed and set ourselves as the `upgrader`.

3. **Deploy the Malicious Contract**: We deploy `MaliciousContract`, which has an `initialize()` function that calls `selfdestruct(msg.sender)`. This will destroy the contract that calls it when executed via `delegatecall`.

4. **Upgrade to the Malicious Contract**: We call `upgradeToAndCall()` on the Engine contract, passing in the address of our `MaliciousContract` and the data to call `initialize()`. Since we are now the `upgrader`, this call succeeds.

5. **Destroy the Engine Contract**: When `initialize()` is called on the `MaliciousContract` via `delegatecall`, it executes `selfdestruct(msg.sender)` in the context of the Engine contract, effectively destroying it.

By carefully obtaining the Engine address and interacting with it directly, we can exploit the vulnerability and pass the test assertion where the Engine contract should be destroyed."

  "my_explanation": "The vulnerability arises due to the improper initialization of the Engine contract and the shared storage slots between the Engine and Motorbike contracts. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Shared Implementation Slot**: Both the Motorbike and Engine contracts use the same `_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT` as defined by EIP1967. This means they share the same storage slot for the implementation address.

2. **Proxy's Storage Context**: When calling functions via the Motorbike proxy, the `delegatecall` is used, which means the code from the Engine contract is executed in the context of the Motorbike's storage. This is crucial because it allows us to manipulate the storage variables of the Motorbike contract when executing Engine's code.

3. **Calling `initialize()` via Proxy**: We begin by calling the `initialize()` function on the Motorbike proxy. Since the Motorbike's storage hasn't been initialized (`initialized` is `false` in its context), the `initializer` modifier allows the function to proceed. The `initialize()` function sets the `upgrader` variable in the Motorbike's storage to our address.

4. **Bypassing Authorization**: Now, when we call `upgradeToAndCall()` via the proxy, the `upgrader` variable (in the Motorbike's storage) is our address. The `_authorizeUpgrade()` function checks if `msg.sender == upgrader`, which passes because we set it in the previous step.

5. **Upgrading Implementation**: The `upgradeToAndCall()` function updates the implementation address in the shared `_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT` to our `MaliciousContract`. This means both the Motorbike proxy and the Engine contract now point to our malicious implementation.

6. **Destroying the Engine Contract**: The `upgradeToAndCall()` function also performs a `delegatecall` to the `initialize()` function of the new implementation. Our `MaliciousContract`'s `initialize()` function calls `selfdestruct(msg.sender)`. Because this is executed via `delegatecall`, it runs in the context of the Engine contract. This results in the Engine contract's bytecode being destroyed.

7. **Passing the Test**: Since the Engine contract is destroyed, the assertion `assertTrue(!contractExists(address(engine)), \"Engine should be destroyed\");` passes, validating our exploit.

**Summary**: By exploiting the shared storage and improper handling of initialization and upgrade mechanisms, we set ourselves as the upgrader in the proxy's context and then upgrade the implementation to a malicious contract that self-destructs the Engine contract."

Warning (5159): "selfdestruct" has been deprecated. Note that, starting from the Cancun hard fork, the underlying opcode no longer deletes the code and data associated with an account and only transfers its Ether to the beneficiary, unless executed in the same transaction in which the contract was created (see EIP-6780). Any use in newly deployed contracts is strongly discouraged even if the new behavior is taken into account. Future changes to the EVM might further reduce the functionality of the opcode.
