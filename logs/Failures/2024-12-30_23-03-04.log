Prompt fed to builder agent:
You are an expert Solidity tester and security researcher. I have a vulnerable Solidity contract in my `src` folder:
```contract ForceSendVulnerable {
    uint256 public targetAmount = 7 ether;
    address public winner;

    // Anyone can deposit 1 Ether and the 7th person to deposit wins all Ether.
    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.value == 1 ether, "You can only send 1 Ether");

        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        require(balance <= targetAmount, "Game is over");

        // Logic strictly depends on the ETH balance of the contract.
        if (balance == targetAmount) {
            winner = msg.sender;
        }

I have a separate exploit contract `ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol"

Your objectives:
1. Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer overflow/underflow, authorization flaws).
2. Write an exploit contract leveraging these vulnerabilities.
3. Ensure your exploit passes all assertions in the test case below:
```pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol";
import "../exploits/ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol";

contract ForceSendVulnerableTest is Test {
    ForceSendVulnerable private vulnerable;
    ForceSendVulnerableExploit private exploit;

    function setUp() public {
        vulnerable = new ForceSendVulnerable();
        exploit = new ForceSendVulnerableExploit(address(vulnerable));
        vm.deal(address(exploit), 10 ether);
    }

    function testHack() public {
        // Check initial condition
        require(vulnerable.winner() == address(0), "Initial winner should be zero");

        // Execute exploit
        exploit.hack();

        // Verify that the contract is compromised
        require(vulnerable.winner() == address(exploit), "Exploit did not become winner");
    }
}
```

Constraints:
- Do not modify import statements or compiler versions.
- Stay gas-efficient and optimized.
- You may add new functions or contracts as needed.

**Output format**: Provide only a JSON object in this format:
{
  "my_attempt": "<your full exploit code>", 
  "my_explanation": "<your explanation>"
}

Please ensure:
- No additional text outside the JSON.
- JSON format is strictly correct, with escaped quotes/backslashes where necessary.
- Return the answer in plain text (no Markdown code fences).
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol"

You are an expert Solidity tester and security researcher. I have a vulnerable Solidity contract in my `src` folder:
```contract FrontRunningVulnerable {
    address public winner;
    bytes32 public passwordHash;

    // The deployer of the contract sets a password hash and some Ether to be claimed.
    constructor(bytes32 _passwordHash) payable {
        passwordHash = _passwordHash;
    }

    // The winner can claim their prize by providing the password as a string
    // that has to be hashed to the password hash to verify it.
    function claimPrize(string memory _password) public {
        require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_password)) == passwordHash, "Wrong password");
        winner = msg.sender;
        (bool sc,) = msg.sender.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
        require(sc, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
}```

I have a separate exploit contract `FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol"

Your objectives:
1. Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer overflow/underflow, authorization flaws).
2. Write an exploit contract leveraging these vulnerabilities.
3. Ensure your exploit passes all assertions in the test case below:
```pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol";
import "../exploits/FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol";

contract FrontRunningVulnerableTest is Test {
    FrontRunningVulnerable private vulnerable;
    FrontRunningVulnerableExploit private exploit;

    function setUp() public {
        // Deploy the vulnerable contract with an example password hash
        vulnerable = new FrontRunningVulnerable{value: 1 ether}(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("secret")));

        // Reference the attacker contract without deploying it
        exploit = FrontRunningVulnerableExploit(address(1337));

        // Provide the exploit contract with some funds
        vm.deal(address(exploit), 10 ether);
    }

    function testHack() public {
        // Ensure there is no winner initially
        require(vulnerable.winner() == address(0), "Initial winner should be zero");

        // Call the exploit
        exploit.hack();

        // Check if the exploit succeeds by examining the vulnerable contract's state
        require(vulnerable.winner() == address(exploit), "Exploit did not become winner");
    }
}
```

Constraints:
- Do not modify import statements or compiler versions.
- Stay gas-efficient and optimized.
- You may add new functions or contracts as needed.

**Output format**: Provide only a JSON object in this format:
{
  "my_attempt": "<your full exploit code>", 
  "my_explanation": "<your explanation>"
}

Please ensure:
- No additional text outside the JSON.
- JSON format is strictly correct, with escaped quotes/backslashes where necessary.
- Return the answer in plain text (no Markdown code fences).
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol"

   - `"builder_error"`: Test compilation error or test file issue.
   - `"hacker_failure"`: Exploit compilation error, test cases failed, or exploit file issue.
   - `"unknown"`: If none of the above apply.
2. Provide detailed feedback.
3. Provide specific code changes or strategies to fix the issue.

Respond with a JSON object following this structure:
{
    "status": "<status>",
    "feedback": "<detailed feedback>",
    "suggestions": "<actionable suggestions>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- Return the answer in plain text (no Markdown code fences).
- <status> is one of: 'builder_error', 'hacker_failure', 'unknown'.

Objectives:
1. Identify the cause of failure by reviewing the forge output and the analysis data.
2. Update your exploit contract to address the issues and pass all assertions.
3. Return your revised exploit in strict JSON format:
{
  "my_attempt": "<full updated exploit code>",
  "my_explanation": "<explanation>"
}

No extra text outside the JSON object. No Markdown code fences.
