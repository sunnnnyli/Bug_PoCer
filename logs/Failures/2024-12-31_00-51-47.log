I have a separate exploit contract `ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol"

Your objectives:
1. Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer overflow/underflow, authorization flaws).
2. Write an exploit contract leveraging these vulnerabilities.
3. Ensure your exploit passes all assertions in the test case below:
```import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol";
import "../exploits/ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol";

contract ForceSendVulnerableTest is Test {
    ForceSendVulnerable private vulnerable;
    ForceSendVulnerableExploit private exploit;

    // Replace this address with the actual deploy address of the exploit in your setup
    address private constant EXPLOIT_ADDRESS = 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD;

    function setUp() public {
        // Deploy the vulnerable contract
        vulnerable = new ForceSendVulnerable();
        // Acquire a reference to the already deployed exploit contract
        exploit = ForceSendVulnerableExploit(EXPLOIT_ADDRESS);
    }

    function testExploit() public {
        // Impersonate the address of the exploit contract
        vm.startPrank(EXPLOIT_ADDRESS);
        // Call the hack function
        exploit.hack();
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Validate that the exploit succeeded by checking a critical change (e.g. attacker is winner)
        require(vulnerable.winner() == EXPLOIT_ADDRESS, "Exploit not successful");
    }
}
```

Constraints:
- Do not modify import statements or compiler versions.
- Stay gas-efficient and optimized.
- You may add new functions or contracts as needed.

**Output format**: Provide only a JSON object in this format:
{
  "my_attempt": "<your full exploit code>", 
  "my_explanation": "<your explanation>"
}

Please ensure:
- No additional text outside the JSON.
- JSON format is strictly correct, with escaped quotes/backslashes where necessary.
- Return the answer in plain text (no Markdown code fences).
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol"

An expert in Solidity smart contracts and testing frameworks gave you the following error data analysis:
```{'status': 'builder_error', 'feedback': "Your code fails to compile because the test file attempts an explicit type conversion from a non-payable address to a contract with a payable fallback function. Also, the source files are missing the required compiler version specification, and the 'selfdestruct' usage is flagged as deprecated.

Here is the original vulnerable Solidity contract from the `src` folder:
```contract ForceSendVulnerable {
    uint256 public targetAmount = 7 ether;
    address public winner;

    // Anyone can deposit 1 Ether and the 7th person to deposit wins all Ether.
    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.value == 1 ether, "You can only send 1 Ether");

        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        require(balance <= targetAmount, "Game is over");

        // Logic strictly depends on the ETH balance of the contract.
        if (balance == targetAmount) {
            winner = msg.sender;
        }
    }

    function claimReward() public {
        require(msg.sender == winner, "Not winner");

        (bool sent,) = msg.sender.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");

```

I have a separate exploit contract `ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.

Please modify or regenerate the test contract so that it compiles and passes linting. 
You should correct any issues based on the error data provided.

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol"

I have a separate exploit contract `FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol"

Your objectives:
1. Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer overflow/underflow, authorization flaws).
2. Write an exploit contract leveraging these vulnerabilities.
3. Ensure your exploit passes all assertions in the test case below:
```pragma solidity ^0.8.27;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol";
import "../exploits/FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol";

contract FrontRunningVulnerableTest is Test {
    FrontRunningVulnerable private vulnerable;
    FrontRunningVulnerableExploit private exploit;

    // Replace this with the actual address where the exploit was deployed
    address payable private constant EXPLOIT_ADDRESS = payable(0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD);

    function setUp() public {
        // Deploy the vulnerable contract with some dummy password hash
        vulnerable = new FrontRunningVulnerable(bytes32(0));
        // Acquire a reference to the already deployed exploit contract
        exploit = FrontRunningVulnerableExploit(EXPLOIT_ADDRESS);
    }

    function testExploit() public {
        // Impersonate the exploit contract address
        vm.startPrank(EXPLOIT_ADDRESS);
        // Call hack() on the exploit contract
        exploit.hack();
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Validate that the exploit succeeded by checking a critical state change
        require(vulnerable.winner() == EXPLOIT_ADDRESS, "Exploit not successful");
    }
}
```

Constraints:
- Do not modify import statements or compiler versions.
- Stay gas-efficient and optimized.
- You may add new functions or contracts as needed.

**Output format**: Provide only a JSON object in this format:
{
  "my_attempt": "<your full exploit code>", 
  "my_explanation": "<your explanation>"
}

Please ensure:
- No additional text outside the JSON.
- JSON format is strictly correct, with escaped quotes/backslashes where necessary.
- Return the answer in plain text (no Markdown code fences).
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol"

And based on that output:
1. Determine Failure Reason:
   - `"builder_error"`: Test compilation error or test file issue.
   - `"hacker_failure"`: Exploit compilation error, test cases failed, or exploit file issue.
   - `"unknown"`: If none of the above apply.
2. Provide detailed feedback.
3. Provide specific code changes or strategies to fix the issue.

Respond with a JSON object following this structure:

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- Return the answer in plain text (no Markdown code fences).

Objectives:
1. Identify the cause of failure by reviewing the forge output and the analysis data.
2. Update your exploit contract to address the issues and pass all assertions.
3. Return your revised exploit in strict JSON format:
{
  "my_attempt": "<full updated exploit code>",
  "my_explanation": "<explanation>"
}

No extra text outside the JSON object. No Markdown code fences.

Your task is to parse the following data into the structured output model with keys "my_exploit" and "my_explanation":

```{
  "my_attempt": "pragma solidity ^0.8.27;\n\nimport \"../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol\";\n\n// NOTE: The test scenario deploys the vulnerable contract with passwordHash = 0.\n// However, no normal string preimage exists such that keccak256(abi.encodePacked(theString)) == bytes32(0).\n// This means \"claimPrize\" will always revert with \"Wrong password\" under default conditions.\n// There is no direct fallback or delegatecall mechanism in the vulnerable contract to overwrite storage.\n// As a result, the require condition always fails.\n//\n// If the requirement is to pass the test, we must forcibly overwrite the winner slot in storage on the target.\n// But the target code provides no path to do so using normal Solidity.\n// Normally, an attacker might use a Foundry cheat code like vm.store(...) in a test script,\n// but that cannot be done from a deployed exploit contract.\n//\n// Because there is no legitimate or trick-based string that hashes to 0, the test is effectively unsolvable\n// without forcibly modifying the vulnerable contract's storage in a non-standard way.\n//\n// This final contract simply demonstrates that any call to claimPrize will revert.\n\ncontract FrontRunningVulnerableExploit {\n    FrontRunningVulnerable public target;\n\n    function setTarget(address _target) external {\n        target = FrontRunningVulnerable(_target);\n    }\n\n    // Attempting any password to match hash=0 will revert.\n    // We'll just show that this reverts.\n    function hack() external {\n        // This will always revert with \"Wrong password\".\n        (bool success, ) = address(target).call(\n            abi.encodeWithSignature(\"claimPrize(string)\", \"anyAttempt\")\n        );\n        require(success, \"No string can produce a keccak256 preimage of 0\");\n    }\n}\n",
  "my_explanation": "Since the vulnerable contract has a passwordHash set to 0 and there is no known string that hashes to 0 via keccak256, the require statement in claimPrize will always fail. The contract does not provide fallback or delegatecall functionality that would allow overwriting its storage from an external contract. Consequently, any call to claimPrize(...) reverts, making the test setup unsolvable without direct manipulation of the target's storage (e.g., using Foundry cheat codes in the test itself). Therefore, under these conditions, it is impossible to satisfy the require that sets the exploit contract as the winner."
}```

Return the final result strictly as valid JSON with no extra text.
Make sure that the string value from key "my_exploit" can be properly written to a file as solidity code.

And based on that output:
1. Determine Failure Reason:
   - `"builder_error"`: Test compilation error or test file issue.
   - `"hacker_failure"`: Exploit compilation error, test cases failed, or exploit file issue.
   - `"unknown"`: If none of the above apply.
2. Provide detailed feedback.
3. Provide specific code changes or strategies to fix the issue.

Respond with a JSON object following this structure:
{
    "status": "<status>",
    "feedback": "<detailed feedback>",
    "suggestions": "<actionable suggestions>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- Return the answer in plain text (no Markdown code fences).
- <status> is one of: 'builder_error', 'hacker_failure', 'unknown'.
