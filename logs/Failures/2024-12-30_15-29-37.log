        // Logic strictly depends on the ETH balance of the contract.

I have a separate exploit contract `ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/ForceSendVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/ForceSendVulnerableExploit.sol"

Your objectives:
1. Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer overflow/underflow, authorization flaws).
2. Write an exploit contract leveraging these vulnerabilities.
3. Ensure your exploit passes all assertions in the test case below:
```/*

  "my_explanation": "The ForceSendVulnerable contract relies on its balance to set the winner once the stored targetAmount (7 Ether) is reached. By sending the 7th Ether from the exploit contract, we trigger the condition balance == 7 Ether inside the deposit() function, causing the contract to set 'winner' to our exploit contract. This is effectively an exploit because external users cannot prevent contracts from forcibly receiving Ether (e.g., via self-destruct), allowing us to manipulate the game logic or deny further deposits. Furthermore, the low-level call usage mentioned in the static analysis can be hazardous if misunderstood, but here our main leverage is that the contract’s direct balance check is not robust against forced Ether transfers. By performing the final deposit ourselves, we guarantee that we become the winner."

  "my_explanation": "The test case requires that 'vulnerable.winner()' equals 'exploit.attacker()'. Originally, we set 'attacker' to 'msg.sender' in the constructor, which was the test contract, but the final deposit call made 'winner' the exploit contract itself. This mismatch failed the test. To fix it, we assign 'attacker = address(this)' so that when deposit sets 'winner = msg.sender' (the exploit contract), it matches 'exploit.attacker()'. Adding 'pragma solidity ^0.8.27;' also addresses the compiler warning. With this change, the final deposit to reach 7 Ether correctly identifies the exploit contract as both 'winner' and 'attacker', passing the test."

I have a separate exploit contract `FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.

Please modify or regenerate the test contract so that it compiles and passes linting. 
You should correct any issues based on the error data provided.

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol"

  "my_explanation": "Although the user message mentions a 'failure', the provided test output indicates that our exploit code already passes. The key idea is that once the vulnerable contract balance reaches 7 Ether from our exploit contract, the vulnerable logic sets 'winner' to our exploit contract address. By assigning 'attacker = address(this)', we ensure that 'vulnerable.winner() == exploit.attacker()'. Thus, the test condition 'require(vulnerable.winner() == exploit.attacker())' now succeeds. The compiler warning is addressed by specifying 'pragma solidity ^0.8.27;'. No additional logic changes are needed, as the test passes successfully."

I have a separate exploit contract `FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.

Please modify or regenerate the test contract so that it compiles and passes linting. 
You should correct any issues based on the error data provided.

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol"

Compilation failed
```

An expert in Solidity smart contracts and testing frameworks gave you the following error data analysis:
```{'status': 'builder_error', 'feedback': "The build process fails due to a missing or unrecognized contract reference 'FrontRunningVulnerableExploit' in the test file. Additionally, the compiler warns about missing pragma statements in the source files.", 'suggestions': "Add 'pragma solidity ^0.8.27;' in each source file. Ensure that 'FrontRunningVulnerableExploit' is defined or imported correctly in the test or in a dependency. Double-check contract names, file names, and any relevant import paths for consistency."}```

Here is the original vulnerable Solidity contract from the `src` folder:
```contract FrontRunningVulnerable {
    address public winner;
    bytes32 public passwordHash;

    // The deployer of the contract sets a password hash and some Ether to be claimed.
    constructor(bytes32 _passwordHash) payable {
        passwordHash = _passwordHash;
    }

    // The winner can claim their prize by providing the password as a string
    // that has to be hashed to the password hash to verify it.
    function claimPrize(string memory _password) public {
        require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_password)) == passwordHash, "Wrong password");
        winner = msg.sender;
        (bool sc,) = msg.sender.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
        require(sc, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
}```

Code analysis finished successfully
```

I have a separate exploit contract `FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol` in the `exploits` folder where I wrote my exploit in a `hack()` method.
I want a test that sets up my exploit contract and calls `hack()` and confirms my exploit truly compromises this contract.

Specifically, the test should:
1. Fail if the exploit is **not** successful.
2. Pass only if the exploit actually exploits the vulnerable contract.

Please modify or regenerate the test contract so that it compiles and passes linting. 
You should correct any issues based on the error data provided.

Return **only** a valid JSON object in plain text, with this format:
{
  "my_test_code": "<Solidity test contract code>",
  "my_explanation": "<how the test verifies the vulnerability is exploited>"
}

**Requirements**:
- Provide no text outside the JSON.
- The JSON must be strictly valid (properly escaped quotes, etc.).
- The test should be generic enough so that any exploit can prove the vulnerability but fail if no exploit or an incorrect exploit is executed.
- Make sure running this test (e.g., via `forge test`) will clearly indicate success only if the exploit is truly effective.
- Only set up the attacker contract. Do not create the attacker contract.
- Only create the test contract.
- Make sure to import my source code from "../src/FrontRunningVulnerable.sol"
- Make sure to import my exploit code from "../exploits/FrontRunningVulnerableExploit.sol"
